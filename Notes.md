# Topological Sort
- Essentially the same thing as a DFS but it uses a list at the end of the for loop and append the vertex to it, then return the list. Then when calling the method print it to see the proper topological sort

# Dijkstra's Algorithm
- dict.items() returns a list of dictionary keys and values
- [vertex1 for vertex2 in graph] creates a list where vertex1 is plugged into vertex2 which iterates through graph and then sets vertex1 to the value and creates a list from this
